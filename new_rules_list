# New Rules
- 1. Don't pick up the phone
   - you know he's only calling because he's drunk and alone
- 2. Don't let him in
    - you'll have to kick him out again
- 3. Don't be his friend 
   - you know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning 
and if you're under him you're never getting over him
